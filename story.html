<p>
    A boy asks his mother, "Mother, can I be a bird and travel the world?". His mother says, looking at the sunset 
    and taking him in her lap, "You can." He is always fascinated by birds, butterflies, and beauty. 
    Every day, after finishing his studies, he comes here. He thinks,
</p>
<p>
    "Is this my home? Why does this place call me so much?"
</p>
<p>
     He's grown up. Someday at night, his mother says, "They're calling me, son; they are waiting for me there. It's my time to go. 
    Son, in the future, I will come to take you to your real home." He doesn't understand anything. His mother says goodbye. His tears 
    roll down. Day passes. He waits for his mother to come and take him to the world of peace and kindness. Here he feels his heart is 
    heavy and tired, his mind has so many thoughts that he cannot express, and he feels he is not brave enough for the world. 
</p>
<p>
    He wonders why he cannot be like them. What is the thing he is not capable of? why he is like this. why.. why?
</p>
<p>
   He runs to that place, which he loves ,but that day he asks angrily, "Why are you making me wait? What is the thing I did not 
   understand? I feel tired. Can you not see, mother?" He hears a voice gently approaching him amd says, "Eliminate all the voices 
   that say you are wrong and make you feel that you are not capable of things like others; start seeing things as they are; 
   and distribute your knowledge to those who feel the same as you. I know it is tough, but we are here for you."Suddenly, 
   he feels protected and powerful. He understands that what he thinks is weakness can actually be strength.
</p>
   "We need each other." One by one, he wins many games of life; many people thank him and respect him, but still he waits for the call
   from her mother.
<p>

One day at night, he lay down under the tree where his mother used to sit and watch him play. He sees stars sparkling in the sky, 
the leaves making a welcoming sound, and the crickets singing the song of happiness, just like the day when her mother went to her home. 
He feels nature congratulating him. He hears the beautiful, gentle voice and sees that she is his mother. His mother is calling him. He
cries in joy and asks, "Mother, you came? I waited". His mother hugged him and said, "Let's go to your world, son. Everyone is waiting for 
you". and his mother takes him to the world where he belongs. They leave the world behind. He is thankful to this world. HE LEAVES.
Finally, he is free.
